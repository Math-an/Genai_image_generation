# **AI Text-to-Image Generator via Google Colab & WebSockets**  

This project enables AI-based **text-to-image generation** using **Google Colab** as the backend and **WebSockets** for real-time communication. It allows **low-end PCs** to generate AI images without requiring a powerful GPU.  

By leveraging **Google Colab's free GPU**, users can offload the computation to the cloud while controlling the image generation process from a local web interface.  

---

## **🚀 How It Works**  

1️⃣ **Google Colab** runs an AI model to generate images based on user prompts.  
2️⃣ A **WebSocket server** is hosted in Colab, allowing real-time communication.  
3️⃣ **Ngrok** is used to expose the WebSocket server over the internet.  
4️⃣ The **frontend (HTML, JavaScript, TailwindCSS)** interacts with the WebSocket server to request and display images.  

This approach makes **AI-powered image generation accessible to users with low-end PCs**, as they only need a browser to run it.

## **🛠 Setup & Installation**  

### **1️⃣ Run the Google Colab Notebook**  
- Open **`imagegeneration.ipynb`** in **Google Colab**.  
- Run all the cells.  
- The notebook will generate a **WebSocket URL (wss://...)** using **Ngrok**.  

### **2️⃣ Update WebSocket URL in `index.html`**  
After running the notebook, update the WebSocket connection URL in your frontend code:  
```js
const wsUrl = "wss://your-generated-url.ngrok-free.app/ws";
```
📌 **This step is required each time you restart the Colab notebook, as the URL changes.**  

### **3️⃣ Open `index.html` in Your Browser**  
Simply open the file in a browser, enter a prompt, and start generating images!

## **⚠ Known Issues & Fixes**  

### **1️⃣ WebSocket Not Connecting?**  
🔹 Ensure the Colab notebook is running and **Ngrok** is providing a valid URL.  
🔹 Update the **WebSocket URL** in the script after every restart of the notebook.  
🔹 Check browser console errors (`F12 > Console`).  

### **2️⃣ No Image Output?**  
🔹 Ensure the **Colab notebook** is running all cells without errors.  
🔹 The WebSocket server should return **base64-encoded images** in JSON format.
