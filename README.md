📌 Demo


📦 Installation & Setup
1️⃣ Clone the Repository

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/your-username/text-to-image-websocket.git
cd text-to-image-websocket
2️⃣ Run WebSocket Server (If Not Already Running)
Ensure you have a WebSocket server that processes image generation requests. Example:

bash
Copy
Edit
python server.py  # If using a Python WebSocket backend
3️⃣ Open index.html in Your Browser

bash
Copy
Edit
open index.html  # MacOS
start index.html  # Windows
or simply double-click the file to open it.

🚀 Usage
Enter a prompt describing the image.
Set image count, quality, and accuracy.
Click "Generate Images" and wait for AI to create them.
View and download the generated images.
⚙️ WebSocket Server Setup
This project requires a WebSocket server to process requests. Update the WebSocket URL in index.html to match your server:

js
Copy
Edit
const wsUrl = "wss://your-server-url/ws"; 
Make sure your server sends base64-encoded image data in JSON format:

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "images": ["base64_encoded_image_1", "base64_encoded_image_2"]
}
🛠 Troubleshooting
🔴 WebSocket Not Connecting?
Ensure your WebSocket server is running (wss://your-server-url/ws).
If using ngrok, update the WebSocket URL after restarting it.
Check for browser console errors (F12 > Console).
⚠ Images Not Appearing?
Ensure the server sends valid base64-encoded images in JSON format.
Check the WebSocket logs for error messages.
